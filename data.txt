review: I recommend this book to all my medical students because lessons, stories, 
    advice from this artistic work applies both in engineering as well as in the medical field.

review: I wish I had a role model like her to outline my goals and dreams in order to avoid the common 
    mistakes of a young and enthusiastic engineer. Buy, read, and offer a copy to someone younger than you!

review: This a classic GPS for this generation; it outlines what to do, what not to do, when to do it, 
    how to do it, and why taking the risk is the greatest legacy you can ever give yourself.
